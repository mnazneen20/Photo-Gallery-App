# Photo Gallery App

I used the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/) for building this simple `React App`.
--> It shows a collection of 20 images in a grid style.
--> Users can search for images in the seacrchbox.
--> A modal opens up on clicking the zoom button on the image
--> The modal shows some detail information about the image.

The live site is available [here]().
